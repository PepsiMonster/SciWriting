Hello world!

This is the firts real document. Here are some big spaces --- but in pdf the collapse in a single space. 

This is a new paragraph. Here we will try non-breaking space (hard space). \texttt{\string~}:
The hard space is real.

Let's force some potential line breks. This paragraph is intentionally long so LaTeX may decide to break lines in different places depending on page width and the words that appear near the end of each line.

\bigskip
Now we try to print some special charachters.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Curly braces: \{ and \}
  \item Dollar sign: \$ (so we can show money like \$10)
  \item Percent sign: \% (otherwise it starts a comment)
  \item Ampersand: \& (otherwise used in tables)
  \item Hash: \# 
  \item Underscore: \_ (often used in math, so needs escaping in text)
  \item Backslash: \textbackslash
  \item Caret: \textasciicircum
  \item Tilda: \textasciitilde
\end{itemize}

This is going to be our footnote text\footnote{This is the footnote text in person}.
