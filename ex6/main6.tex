\section*{Exercise 6.9 --- Bibliography with \texttt{natbib} (BibTeX workflow)}

\subsection*{1) Basic citations (textual vs parenthetical)}
The mathematics showcase is from \citet{Graham1995}, whereas there is some chemistry in \citet{Thomas2008}.

Some parenthetical citations: \citep{Graham1995} and then \citep[p.~56]{Thomas2008}.

A citation with a short note and page range: \citep[See][pp.~45--48]{Graham1995}.

Multiple citations together: \citep{Graham1995,Thomas2008}.

\subsection*{2) New entry and a new citation}
Here is a citation to a new entry we added to the database: \citet{Lamport1994}.

\subsection*{3) A citation that is not in the database}
This key does not exist in \texttt{learnlatex.bib}: \citep{NotInDatabase}.
(You should see a warning, and the citation will usually appear as \texttt{?}.)
